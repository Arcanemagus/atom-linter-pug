### BREAKING CHANGES

* The `executablePath` setting has been removed and is no longer
available. `linter-pug` will now use your project's local `pug-lint`
when one can be found using the standard `require.resolve`
implementation. If one can't be found local to your project then the
bundled one will be used as a fallback.
